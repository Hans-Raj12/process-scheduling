# process-scheduling

CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold (in waiting state). Due to unavailability of any resources like I/O. CPU job Scheduling plays an essential role in resource utilization and overall performance of a system. Therefore, there are various scheduling algorithms used by CPU to speed-up and improve performance of processor. The algorithms like First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Least-Job-First (SJF), and Shortest-remaining-time-first.  
Our project is to implement simulation of CPU scheduling. When user will run our application, a GUI window will pop-up and ask user to enter processes one by one through ‘Add Process’ button, choose one scheduling algorithms out of three i.e. FCFS, RR, SJF. The output will display average burst-time, average turnaround-time, average waiting time, and throughput.

#	TOOLS USED
o	Java coding 
o	Java swing for GUI 
o	Net beans.


#	 OUTCOME

		In this project we are going to work on the interactive and real time scheduling in which the user will be able to add processes and calculate average time, time needed for every process to be fully executed, etc. by providing different policy options:
1) Shortest-Remaining –Time-First (SRTF)
2) Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
3) ROUND ROBIN (RR
4) First Come First Served (FCFS)
